# Qwiklabs: Working with Python Scripts

## Introduction
Welcome to your first lab on fixing problems in Python. In this lab, you'll first have to fix an incorrect Python script. This includes:

- Fixing the file permissions to make it executable.
- Fixing a bug in the code.

After that, you'll write your own Python module and use it from the original script.

You'll have 90 minutes to complete this lab.
